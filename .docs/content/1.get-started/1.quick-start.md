# Quick start

## Installation

Let's get started with `@p-stream/providers`. First lets install the package.

::alert{type="warning"}
**Note:** The `@p-stream/providers` package is not published on npm. Install it directly from GitHub using the following commands:
::

::code-group
  ```bash [NPM]
  npm install @p-stream/providers@github:p-stream/providers#production
  ```
  ```bash [Yarn]
  yarn add @p-stream/providers@github:p-stream/providers#production
  ```
  ```bash [PNPM]
  pnpm add @p-stream/providers@github:p-stream/providers#production
  ```
::

## Scrape your first item

To get started with scraping on the **server**, first you have to make an instance of the providers.

::alert{type="warning"}
This snippet will only work on a **server**. For other environments, check out [Usage on X](../2.essentials/0.usage-on-x.md).
::

```ts [index.ts (server)]
import { makeProviders, makeStandardFetcher, targets } from '@p-stream/providers';

// this is how the library will make http requests
const myFetcher = makeStandardFetcher(fetch);

// make an instance of the providers library
const providers = makeProviders({
  fetcher: myFetcher,

  // will be played on a native video player
  target: targets.NATIVE
})
```

Perfect. You now have an instance of the providers you can reuse everywhere.
Now let's scrape an item:

```ts [index.ts (server)]
// fetch some data from TMDB
const media = {
  type: 'movie',
  title: "Hamilton",
  releaseYear: 2020,
  tmdbId: "556574"
}
  
const output = await providers.runAll({
  media: media
})
```

Now we have our stream in the output variable. (If the output is `null` then nothing could be found.)
To find out how to use the streams, check out [Using streams](../2.essentials/4.using-streams.md).
