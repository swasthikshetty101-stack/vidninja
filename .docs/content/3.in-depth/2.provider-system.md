# Provider System Overview

Understanding how the provider system works is crucial for building effective scrapers.

## The all.ts Registration System

All scrapers must be registered in `src/providers/all.ts`. This central file exports two main functions that gather all available providers:

```typescript
// src/providers/all.ts
import { Embed, Sourcerer } from '@/providers/base';
import { embedsuScraper } from './sources/embedsu';
import { turbovidScraper } from './embeds/turbovid';

export function gatherAllSources(): Array<Sourcerer> {
  return [
    cuevana3Scraper,
    catflixScraper,
    embedsuScraper,    // Your source scraper goes here
    // ... more sources
  ];
}

export function gatherAllEmbeds(): Array<Embed> {
  return [
    upcloudScraper,
    turbovidScraper,   // Your embed scraper goes here
    // ... more embeds
  ];
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- Only registered scrapers are available to the library
- The order in these arrays doesn't matter (ranking determines priority)
- You must import your scraper and add it to the appropriate function

## Provider Types

There are two distinct types of providers in the system:

### Sources (Primary Scrapers)
**Sources** find content on websites and return either:
- **Direct video streams** (ready to play immediately)
- **Embed URLs** that need further processing by embed scrapers

**Characteristics:**
- Handle website navigation and search
- Process TMDB IDs to find content
- Can return multiple server options
- Located in `src/providers/sources/`

**Example source workflow:**
1. Receive movie/show request with TMDB ID
2. Search the target website for that content
3. Extract embed player URLs or direct streams
4. Return results for further processing

### Embeds (Secondary Scrapers)  
**Embeds** extract playable video streams from embed players:
- Take URLs from sources as input
- Handle player-specific extraction and decryption
- Always return direct streams (never more embeds)

**Characteristics:**
- Focus on one player type (turbovid, mixdrop, etc.)
- Handle complex decryption/obfuscation
- Specialized for specific player technologies
- Located in `src/providers/embeds/`

**Example embed workflow:**
1. Receive embed player URL from a source
2. Fetch and parse the embed page
3. Extract/decrypt the video stream URLs
4. Return playable HLS or MP4 streams

## Ranking System

Every scraper has a **rank** that determines its priority in the execution queue:

### How Ranking Works
- **Higher numbers = Higher priority** (processed first)
- **Each rank must be unique** across all providers
- Sources and embeds have separate ranking spaces
- Failed scrapers are skipped, next rank is tried

### Rank Ranges
Usually ranks should be on 10s: 110, 120, 130...
```typescript
// Typical rank ranges (not enforced, but conventional)
Sources:  1-300
Embeds:   1-250

// Example rankings
export const embedsuScraper = makeSourcerer({
  id: 'embedsu',
  rank: 165,    // Medium priority source
  // ...
});

export const turbovidScraper = makeEmbed({
  id: 'turbovid', 
  rank: 122,    // Medium priority embed
  // ...
});
```

### Choosing a Rank

**For Sources:**
- **200+**: High-quality, reliable sources (fast APIs, good uptime)
- **100-199**: Medium reliability sources (most scrapers fall here)
- **1-99**: Lower priority or experimental sources

**For Embeds:**
- **200+**: Fast, reliable embeds (direct URLs, minimal processing)
- **100-199**: Standard embeds (typical decryption/extraction)
- **1-99**: Slow or unreliable embeds (complex decryption, poor uptime)

### Finding Available Ranks

Before choosing a rank, check what's already taken:

```sh
# Search for existing ranks
grep -r "rank:" src/providers/ | sort -t: -k3 -n
```

Or check the cli to see the ranks.

**Duplicate ranks will cause conflicts!** Always verify your chosen rank is unique before submitting.

## Provider Configuration

Each provider is configured using `makeSourcerer()` or `makeEmbed()`:

### Source Configuration
```typescript
export const mySourceScraper = makeSourcerer({
  id: 'my-source',           // Unique identifier (kebab-case)
  name: 'My Source',         // Display name (human-readable)
  rank: 150,                 // Priority rank (must be unique)
  disabled: false,           // Whether scraper is disabled
  flags: [],                 // Feature flags (see Advanced Concepts)
  scrapeMovie: comboScraper, // Function for movies
  scrapeShow: comboScraper,  // Function for TV shows
});
```

### Embed Configuration
```typescript
export const myEmbedScraper = makeEmbed({
  id: 'my-embed',            // Unique identifier (kebab-case)
  name: 'My Embed',          // Display name (human-readable)
  rank: 120,                 // Priority rank (must be unique)
  disabled: false,           // Whether scraper is disabled
  async scrape(ctx) {        // Single scrape function for embeds
    // ... extraction logic
    return { stream: [...] };
  },
});
```

## How Providers Work Together

The provider system creates a powerful pipeline:

### 1. Source → Embed Chain
```
User Request → Source Scraper → Embed URLs → Embed Scraper → Video Stream → Player
```

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. **User Request** - User wants to watch content
2. **Source Scraper** - Finds content on websites
3. **Embed URLs** - Returns player URLs that need processing
4. **Embed Scraper** - Extracts streams from player URLs
5. **Video Stream** - Final playable stream
6. **Player** - User watches the content

### 2. Multiple Server Options
Sources can provide multiple backup servers:
```typescript
// Source returns multiple embed options
return {
  embeds: [
    { embedId: 'turbovid', url: 'https://turbovid.com/abc' },
    { embedId: 'mixdrop', url: 'https://mixdrop.co/def' },
    { embedId: 'dood', url: 'https://dood.watch/ghi' }
  ]
};
```

### 3. Fallback System
If one embed fails, the system tries the next:
1. Try turbovid embed (rank 122)
2. If fails, try mixdrop embed (rank 198)
3. If fails, try dood embed (rank 173)
4. Continue until success or all options exhausted

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- **IDs**: Use kebab-case (`my-scraper`, not `myMyscraper` or `My_Scraper`)
- **Names**: Use proper capitalization (`VidCloud`, not `vidcloud` or `VIDCLOUD`)
- **Files**: Match the ID (`my-scraper.ts` for ID `my-scraper`)

### Registration Order
- The order in `all.ts` arrays doesn't affect execution (rank does)
- Group similar scrapers together for maintainability
- Add imports at the top, organized logically

### Testing Integration
Always test that your registration works:
```sh
# Verify your scraper appears in the list (interactive mode shows all available)
pnpm cli

# Test your specific scraper
pnpm cli --source-id my-scraper --tmdb-id 11527
```
