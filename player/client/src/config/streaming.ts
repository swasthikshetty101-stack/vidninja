/**
 * Streaming mode recommendations:
 * 
 * For Development:
 * - Use DIRECT mode for faster development and testing
 * - No backend timeout issues
 * - Source URLs visible in browser dev tools
 * 
 * For Production (Security First):
 * - Use PROXY mode if you need complete source hiding
 * - Consider deploying backend to cloud (Railway, Render, Vercel) to eliminate timeout issues
 * - Backend will need more resources and better network connectivity
 * 
 * For Production (Performance First):
 * - Use DIRECT mode for best user experience
 * - Faster loading, no buffering interruptions
 * - Consider this acceptable for most use cases
 * 
 * For Production (Balanced):
 * - Use HYBRID mode
 * - Try direct streaming first, fallback to proxy if needed
 * - Best of both worlds
 * 
 * Console Commands for Testing:
 * - To use direct streaming: localStorage.setItem('streamingMode', 'DIRECT')
 * - To use proxy streaming: localStorage.setItem('streamingMode', 'PROXY')
 * - To use hybrid streaming: localStorage.setItem('streamingMode', 'HYBRID')
 * - Then refresh the page to apply changes
